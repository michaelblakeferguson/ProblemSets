! Euler39 ~ Integer right triangles
! 
! Problem Statement:
! 
! If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral
! length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for
! p = 120.
! 
!		{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}
! 
! For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! Algorithm Explanation:
! 
! Iterates through values of a,b,c and checks if they are a
! pythagorean triplet. If they pass, then they form a right triangle
! and the perimeter is found from a+b+c. Then the triangles array
! uses the perimiter as an index and increments the number of found
! triangles.
